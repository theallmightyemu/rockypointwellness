						BC therapists have the most comprehensive training in North America and are required to continually update their knowledge and expertise from industry experts.
						<br/><br/>

						<h3>Therapeutic Massage</h3>
						<hr/>
						This massage is designed to suit your individual needs. Registered massage therapists (RMT) are trained to assess, treat, and make home care suggestions. They also safely complement medical treatments for conditions such as, but not limited to: headaches (including migraines), diabetes, arthritis, joint replacement, multiple sclerosis, tendonitis, asthma, bursitis, sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome and sports injuries.
						<br/><br/>

						<h4>Benefits of Therapeutic Massage</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Reduces stress, tension, and anxiety</li>
							<li>Increases blood and lymph circulation</li>
							<li>Enhances immune function</li>
							<li>Decreases muscle and soft tissue pain</li>
							<li>Improves flexibility and range of motion</li>
							<li>Decreases soft tissue healing time</li>
							<li>Improves overall health and well being</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>

						<h3>Pregnancy Massage</h3>
						<hr/>
						Massage therapy provides treatment that will address symptoms or conditions associated with pregnancy to encourage a healthy and comfortable pre and postpartum transition. It is recommended to continue with massage therapy after labour, as it reduces the recovery time, promotes relaxation and decreases tension in muscles from the postural demands of motherhood. Women who have had a c-section are strongly encouraged to receive treatment for their surgical scar. This therapy can be provided once you have gotten the OK from your MD/Midwife (around 6 weeks if healing is going well). This will promote formation of a mobile scar helping to speed recovery and prevent any future issues.
						<br/><br/>

						<h4>Indications for and Benefits of Pregnancy Massage</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Hip, sacroiliac, and low back discomfort</li>
							<li>C-section scar tissue release and post surgery support</li>

							<li>Rib pain</li>
							<li>Edema (water retention/swelling) of the extremities (legs/arms)</li>
							<li>Headaches</li>
							<li>Carpal tunnel or nerve compressions (numbness/tingling/weakness)</li>
							<li>Multiple pregnancy, IUI or IVF</li>
							<li>Decrease pain from postural demands of caring for baby (i.e. breastfeeding)</li>
							<li>Promotes relaxation</li>
							<li>Stretch mark prevention</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>


						<h3>Sports Massage</h3>
						<hr/>
						Sports massage is designed to encourage fast recovery and enhance performance in any type of athlete ranging from the weekend warrior to professional athlete. It assists in increasing blood flow, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to the body and removes toxins and waste products that build up during exercise. Massage therapy will encourage tissue mobility in areas that may be restricted, thus improving range of motion. Sports massage can help prevent injuries; however, in the event injuries do occur, it can speed healing time. Consistent massage can assist you in achieving your full athletic potential.
						<br/><br/>

							<li>Prevents loss of mobility</li>
							<li>Breaks down scar tissue</li>
							<li>Pain reduction</li>
						</ul>
						<br/>

						<h3>Swedish Relaxation Massage</h3>
						<hr/>
						This treatment is a system of continuous soothing massage techniques where the therapist works in the same direction as the flow of blood returning to the heart. Swedish massage is a relaxing and nurturing full body massage that relieves underlying tension, anxiety andstress.
						<br/><br/>

						<h4>Benefits of a Swedish massage</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Increases circulation</li>
							<li>Decrease lactic acid, uric acid and other metabolic wastes</li>

						<h3>Common Questions</h3>
						<hr/>
						<div class='question'>
							What can I expect from a massage therapy treatment?
							<div class='answer'>
								For your initial visit it is encouraged to start with a 60 minute treatment as this will allow your therapist time to go over your health history, perform a thorough assessment and treat your specific needs. <br/>Once the assessment is done, the therapist will inform you of what areas they would like to treat, ask for your consent and direct you on how to position yourself on the table. After the therapist leaves the room you will disrobe to your comfort level and then position yourself on the table between the sheets.<br/>Please note that only one area of your body is exposed at a time and the therapist will work within your comfort level and pain limits. At no time should you feel uncomfortable, exposed, or nervous. The massage is your time and is intended to meet your needs and comfort level. Questions are encouraged before, during and after your session.
