						<h3>Chiropractic</h3>
						<hr/>
						The definition of Chiropractic in Greek is broken down as “Chiro” and “praxis” meaning done “by hand.” <br/><br/>

						Doctors of Chiropractic are specialists trained in the diagnosis and treatment of neuromusculoskeletal conditions through manual practice using the hands. 	Chiropractic uses functional movement assessment, orthopaedic tests and physical palpation in order to form a diagnosis and find the root cause of pain and dysfunction. <br/><br/>

						Once a diagnosis is formed, the Chiropractor forms a personalized treatment plan that can include joint mobilization/manipulation, soft tissue therapy, rehabilitation exercises/stretches and patient education in order to treat and prevent further injury.<br/><br/>

						<h3>Common Questions</h3>
						<hr/>
						<div class='question'>
							Do Chiropractors only treat the spine?
							<div class='answer'>
								No.  Although spinal complaints makes up the majority of what a Chiropractor treats; Chiropractors can treat any joint, muscle or nerve in the body.  This can include ankles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows and wrists to name a few. <br/><br/>

						<div class='question'>
							Who can benefit from Chiropractic care?
							<div class='answer'>
								People of all ages, occupations and activity level!  Whether you suffer from chronic pain or an acute injury, Chiropractic can help.  Whether you want to work on posture, get better at an activity, move better or just want to lead a healthier life, Chiropractic can help.
							</div>
						</div><br/>
						<div class='question'>
							Do you need to be in pain to visit a Chiropractor?
							<div class='answer'>
								No.  Chiropractors can help in a number of other areas regarding your health including the prevention of pain and dysfunction.  The most common types of injuries usually occur with repetitive strain or improper movement patterns. Chiropractors can help to ensure your body is moving properly as well as help you maintain better posture.  Chiropractors can also assess areas where you may be weak and provide personalized exercises to overcome this. Regular maintenance care with your chiropractor will help prevent injury flare ups.
							</div>
						</div><br/>
						<div class='question'>
							What is an adjustment? And what is the "crack?"
							<div class='answer'>
								Chiropractors have the ability to assess specific joint for proper movement.  When they find a joint that is not moving correctly relative to its neighbouring joints the Chiropractor can "adjust" that joint using a high velocity low amplitude thrust.  This puts motion back into the joint restoring proper motion.  The "crack" occurs when a joint passes through its normal range of motion and the air pocket within that joint equalizes with outside pressure; similarly to your ears popping when you go up in altitude. Depending on the area being adjusted, there can be temporary discomfort, but overall most patients find this very comfortable and relieving. Your chiropractor will make sure you feel comfortable with your first adjustment!
							</div>
						</div><br/>
						<div class='question'>
							What does an initial appointment consist of?
							<div class='answer'>
								On your first visit your Chiropractor will take a full health history concerning your complaint.  The Chiropractor will then complete a thorough physical examination, which includes but is not limited to range of motion, postural analysis, orthopaedic tests, neurological exams, movement screens and palpation.  Once a diagnosis is formed this will be completely explained to you along with plan of treatment.  Finally you will be treated on your first visit as well.
							</div>
						</div><br/>
						<div class='question'>
							What does a subsequent appointment consist of?
							<div class='answer'>
								Subsequent appointments start with a quick check-in to see how things are feeling since your last visit and the rest of the time is spent treating your complaint.  This can include soft tissue therapy, joint mobilization/manipulation, stretching, rehabilitative exercises and education to prevent injury.
							</div>
						</div><br/>
						<div class='question'>
							I was hurt in an MVA, will ICBC pay for my treatments?
							<div class='answer'>
								Yes. In most normal circumstances, as long as you have a claim number and were recently in an MVA you are eligible to have your treatment paid for by ICBC.
